      Step By Step Music offers Instrumental Music lessons at a number of schools. What is our greatest selling point? Apart from employing highly professional
      teachers that nurture the musical development of their students in an encouraging and positive environment, the lessons are during school hours. This
      saves families all that extra running around afterschool taxiing children to lessons. Also because the lessons are at school, it gives the children
      opportunities to perform at assemblies and other events to show off what all they have learned.
